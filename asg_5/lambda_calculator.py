# 1. Create a new Python file named `lambda_calculator.py`.
# 2. Define a lambda function for addition that takes two arguments and returns their sum.
add = lambda x, y: x + y

# 3. Define a lambda function for subtraction that takes two arguments and returns their difference.
subtract = lambda x, y: x - y

# 4. Define a lambda function for multiplication that takes two arguments and returns their product.
multiply = lambda x, y: x * y

# 5. Define a lambda function for division that takes two arguments and returns their quotient.
divide = lambda x, y: x / y

# 6. Write a main block that calls each lambda function with sample inputs and prints the results.
x = int(20)
y = int(2)
print("Lambda Calculator")
print(add(x, y))
print(subtract(x, y))
print(multiply(x, y))
